Set up Entire CLI in this project with telemetry disabled.                    
                                                                                
  Steps:                                                                        
  1. Run entire enable — if it fails on the telemetry TTY prompt, that's fine,  
  the hooks and config still install
  2. Verify with entire status — should show "Enabled (manual-commit)"          
  3. Ensure telemetry is off: check ~/.config/entire/config.json exists with    
  {"telemetry": false}. If it doesn't exist, create it.                         
  4. Verify the git hook exists at .git/hooks/prepare-commit-msg and contains   
  entire hooks git prepare-commit-msg                                           
  5. Confirm .entire/ is in .gitignore — if not, add it                         
  6. Run a test: git log -1 --format="%B" on the most recent commit — if Entire
  is working, future commits will have an Entire-Checkpoint: trailer appended
  aully

  Do NOT send any telemetry. Do NOT run entire commands that require interactive
   TTY input. If a command fails due to TTY, skip it — the non-interactive parts
   are sufficient.
