### Feature Opportunities

1. **Improved System Prompts for Dedicated Tools**
   - Improved system prompts to more clearly guide model toward using dedicated tools (Read, Edit, Glob, Grep) instead of bash equivalents (`cat`, `sed`, `grep`, `find`)
   - **Keywords matched:** Read, Edit, Glob, Grep, Bash
   - **Impact:** Skills should align with this guidance - ensure skill prompts don't encourage bash for file operations
   - **Impact files:** .claude/skills/**/*.md

### No Action Required

10 changes did not require action:

- Added session resume hint on exit, showing how to continue conversation later
- Added support for full-width (zenkaku) space input from Japanese IME in checkbox selection
- Fixed PDF too large errors permanently locking up sessions
- Fixed bash commands incorrectly reporting failure with "Read-only file system" errors when sandbox mode was enabled
- Fixed a crash that made sessions unusable after entering plan mode when project config in `~/.claude.json` was missing default fields
- Fixed `temperatureOverride` being silently ignored in streaming API path
- Fixed LSP shutdown/exit compatibility with strict language servers that reject null params
- Improved PDF and request size error messages to show actual limits (100 pages, 20MB)
- Reduced layout jitter in the terminal when the spinner appears and disappears during streaming
- Removed misleading Anthropic API pricing from model selector for third-party provider users
